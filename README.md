Submitted by: Karl Dylan Baes

Time spent: 12 hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
W3Schools for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

The glitch editor lacked a good debugger so there were times when I was having a problem with the program and it ended up just being a mispelled word or declaration. With that, I have also only recently started learning web development: front end, back end, etc. so this is all mostly foreign to me. The problem really was the usual learning curve that comes with learning a new language, most of the concepts that are being used are already ingrained so the learning curve really was not as steep as it was when I first started learning how to program.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

In what way are we going to learn more about the back-end development? Moreover, are we going to be using multiple APIs that are widely used in today's web world; ie. Google API, etc. I am very interested in being able to make functional programs through web development, and more specifically in frameworks such as React, node, etc... will we be learning more about such topics? Will we also take it a step further and dive into the topics of cloud and database systems and how we can implement them with web development programs?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

Because I am a huge fan of video games, difficult and competitive ones at that, I would love to add additional features to this game that not only makes it more difficult for the user, but also adds the functionality that allows users to play and compete against each other and see who gets higher scores. I would also want to implement different game modes for this game (ie. fast-paced memory, sound only, colors only, black and white mode, etc etc.), but given the amount of time and the competitiveness of this opportunity, I am going to submit the required portion as soon as possible, and if I have time, I would add my own functionalities as I see fit. If I still had time, I would refactor functions and clean up code as I see fit.
